Welcome to koolaid's documentation!
===================================

Koolaid is just a motley collection of interesting tools that I dont have
anywhere else to put.

I hope to expand it with all the bits'n'bobs I have lying around

I *think* I will try and create some sort of wrapper that imports a bunch of lib
files and their assoc. optparse, then presents a ncurses interface - so you dont
have to remember what tools we have - just bring up the menu and read through,
then it will be possible to execute.
